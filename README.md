Nothing fancy, just my little project done just out of interest😊.
The main idea was to make a site that anyone can go to and write EVERYTHING they want.

Possible ( I don't promise I will do everything) plans for the development of the project:

- Turn it into an anonymous social network.
- Add traffic encryption and additional security perks.
- Create topics for publications
- Maybe create a system of “anonymous profiles” and make gamification. I.e. add such systems as daily/weekly Tasks and ratings and achievements.
